# Introduction to Web Scraping and REST APIs

Web scraping is the process of extracting and parsing data from websites in an automated fashion using a computer program. It's a useful technique for creating datasets for research and learning. While web scraping often involves parsing and processing HTML documents, some platforms also offer REST APIs to retrieve information in a machine-readable format like JSON. In this tutorial, we'll use web scraping and REST APIs to create a real-world dataset.

* Downloading web pages using the requests library
* Inspecting the HTML source code of a web page
* Parsing parts of a website using Beautiful Soup
* Writing parsed information into CSV files
* Using a REST API to retrieve data as JSON
- Combining data from multiple sources
- Using links on a page to crawl a website
